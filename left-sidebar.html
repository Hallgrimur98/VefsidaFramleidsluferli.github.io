                                            <li>13.01.2020</li>
											<dd>Started work on website and finding youtube tutorials on how to code in HTML.</dd>
											<li>14.01.2020</li>
											<dd>Continued work on website, copied exactly what the man was doing in the video to get started.</dd>
											<li>18.01.2020</li>
											<dd>Made a few tweaks to website, to see how everything I coded myself came out.</dd>
											<li>24.01.2020</li>
											<dd>Continued trying to figure out how html coding worked.</dd>
											<li>05.02.2020</li>
											<dd>I drove up to Fablab to begin the first real assignment, Assignment 2. That's the one
												with pressfit laser cutting. I had already found an idea online on what to make, but all 
												I had was a picture to go by. I accepted a lot of help from Arnar and managed to finish
												the assignment then and there.
											</dd>
											<li>06.02.2020</li>
											<dd>Report for Assignment 2 written up.</dd>
											<li>10.02.2020</li>
											<dd>Original idea for website scrapped because it wasn't an ideal type of site for a portfolio.</dd>
											<li>15.02.2020</li>
											<dd>Work on new site begun, a format found on html5up.net found and started work on navbar and front page.</dd>
											<li>19.02.2020</li>
											<dd>I drove again up to Fablab but this time to start assignment 3. I had to make something that could
												not be cut out by a laser cutter, it had to be 3-dimensional. I drew up a case for a toothbrush on 
												the spot but discovered it was too big. I decided to take a 3d object from online and print it. The 
												results can be seen in Assignment 3.
											</dd>
											<li>22.02.2020</li>
											<dd>I knew I had to finish assignment 3 so I downloaded Regard3d and uploaded around 70 pictures of 
												a pretty simple object. It was an orange ball. I decided to have it simple because I really doubted
												the programs ability to scan an object with only 2d pictures from a regular phone.
											</dd>
											<li>02.03.2020</li>
											<dd>Me and my group started our work on our final project, began discussing what we wanted to make and 
												began drawing it up in Inventor. There were around 3-4 idead in circulation.
											</dd>
											<li>05.03.2020</li>
											<dd>The group talked about how we wanted to split the roles for this project.</dd>
											<li>29.03.2020</li>
											<dd>Me and my group started some real work on our final big project. We had decided to make a cutting board
												using resin and wood. I had the role of drawing it up in Inventor while they looked and commented for 
												me to make some changes somewhere. Unfortunately due to the pandemic, we were not allowed to go to 
												Fablab and manufacture it.
											</dd>
											<li>30.03.2020</li>
											<dd>MIT license for the big project made.</dd>
											<li>02.04.2020</li>
											<dd>We met up online and decided to make some aesthetic changes to our cutting board. It looked a bit rough
												in Inventor before but the changes really made a difference.
											</dd>
											<li>14.04.2020</li>
											<dd>I realized I had to catch up some work on the website so I decided to work on it for some hours.</dd>
											<li>15.04.2020</li>
											<dd>Continued work on website and got it up to date.</dd>
											<li>26.04.2020</li>
											<dd>Made and edited the final video for the big project.</dd>
											<li>10.05.2020</li>
											<dd>Discovered that the deadline had passed me by to turn my web page in and worked furiously for 6 hours trying to upload it.</dd>
											<li>11.05.2020</li>
											<dd>Finished work on the website and uploaded it.</dd>
